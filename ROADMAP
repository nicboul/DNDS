DNDS - Dynamic Network Directory Service ROADMAP
------------------------------------------------
Last updated: 2013-06-22


This ROADMAP file represent everything that has to be developped. If you are
interested by anything listed below, please contact the dynvpn development team.


>> Web management platform
---------------------------
Desc: The web platform will be written in Python/Django and will interact
with the DNDS protocol via a Python/asn1 library called libdnm (taken from dsctl).

- Delete a context from an account
- Delete a node to a context
- Regenerate provisioning-key
- Send invitation via an email
- control the maximum account possible (and being able to increase it easily)
- Commecial account should be able to pay via paypal (or other)


>> Multi platform VPN client
-----------------------------
Desc: The portable VPN client will be written in C++/Qt and will work on
BSD/Linux/Windows/MacOSX. The DNDS protocol that is part of libdnds will need
to be extracted and be made in a seperate library that will be cross-platform
and to which the VPN client will be linked. The work for the dynvpn-client
should be derivated from dnc.

Core
- p2p non-blocking

GUI
- list of reachable nodes with online status
- systray icon

Platform
- Windows
	- Installer
	- OpenSSL manual compilation (not pre-compiled)
- MacOSX

>> DNDS library (libdnds)
-------------------------
Desc: This is the main library that contains all the subsystems used
by the different DNDS components.

- udt patch should be pushed upstream
- udt should use epoll


>> Dynamic Network Daemon (DND)
-------------------------------
Desc: DND represent the server that spawn virtual-switch into which nodes get
connected.

- dynamic arp inspection
- dhcp snooping to build trust table
- check MAC validity
- jlog (journal log subsystem)


>> Directory Service (DSD)
--------------------------
Desc: DSD represent the server that is responsible to interface the database.
DSD interact with both DND and the web-interface.

[DND] <- fetch context      -> [DSD] <- add new context -> [web-interface]
      <- update node status ->       <- list all nodes  ->
      <- ask for prov-key   ->       <- ...             ->
      <- ...                ->

- delete account, context, node
- properly handle IP address format
- create all certificates the first time
- jlog (journal log subsystem)


>> DNDS Automated Building Plateform
------------------------------------
Desc: When code in git is pushed, it should be fetched by Jenkins, than compiled
and tested and then package should be created.

- automate the build process
	- linux debian, redhat, arch
	- OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD
	- Windows, MacOSX
	- i386, ppc, arm

- setup jenkins server
